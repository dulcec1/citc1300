     <h2>What is Pokémon?</h2>
     <p>Pokémon (short for "Pocket Monsters") is a media franchise that started with video games and exploded into a global phenomenon spanning TV shows, movies, toys, and a trading card game. In the games, you play as a Pokémon Trainer, capturing and training Pokémon to battle other Trainers in the quest to become a Pokémon Champion. The main goal is to collect as many Pokémon as possible, with each Pokémon possessing unique abilities, stats, and types.

        The tagline of the series is "Gotta catch 'em all!", which perfectly encapsulates the excitement and adventure of becoming a Pokémon Trainer. Players venture through various regions, battling Gym Leaders, competing in tournaments, and uncovering legendary and mythical Pokémon.</p>

        <h3>The History of Pokémon</h3>
        <p>Pokémon was created by Satoshi Tajiri and developed by Game Freak. The first game, Pokémon Red and Green (released as Red and Blue in the U.S.), was released for the Game Boy in 1996. The game’s concept was inspired by Tajiri’s childhood interest in collecting creatures and his love for nature, leading to the idea of capturing creatures known as Pokémon.

            The franchise quickly grew in popularity, expanding beyond games into a television series, movies, a trading card game, merchandise, and more. With each new generation of games and regions (like Johto, Sinnoh, and Galar), Pokémon has evolved, introducing new features, characters, and gameplay mechanics.
            
            Here’s a brief timeline of Pokémon’s evolution:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1996: Pokémon Red/Green and the original Pokémon anime debut in Japan.
                </li>
                <li>1997-1998: Pokémon anime reaches global audiences, including the U.S.</li>
                <li>1998-2000: The Pokémon Trading Card Game and other spin-offs are released.</li>

            </ul>

           <h3>Pokémon in Popular Culture</h3> 
           <p>From TV shows to social media, Pokémon’s influence is everywhere. The iconic yellow electric mouse Pikachu became a cultural symbol, appearing in commercials, music videos, and even in collaboration with brands like McDonald's, Coca-Cola, and more. The Pokémon brand has become one of the highest-grossing entertainment franchises globally.

            The worldwide phenomenon Pokémon GO, released in 2016, brought the Pokémon universe into the real world, allowing players to catch Pokémon through augmented reality (AR). Events like the Pokémon World Championships and fan conventions continue to unite Trainers from around the globe, creating a passionate and diverse community.</p>
