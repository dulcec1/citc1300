        <h1>Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG): Collect, Battle, and Trade</h1>
        <p>The Pokémon TCG brings the excitement of Pokémon battles off the screen and onto a table. This page explores everything from the game’s history and rules to the collectible aspects and competitive scene that make the Pokémon TCG a global phenomenon.</p>
       
        <h2> Introduction to the Pokémon TCG</h2>
        <p>The Pokémon Trading Card Game is a collectible card game where players assume the role of Pokémon Trainers. By building decks from a vast pool of cards—including Pokémon, Energy, and Trainer cards—players engage in strategic battles with the goal of “knocking out” their opponent’s Pokémon. With a perfect blend of strategy, luck, and collectible appeal, the Pokémon TCG has captured the hearts of players of all ages since its debut in the mid-1990s. </p>
       
       <h2>A Brief History</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Launch and Early Success:
            Introduced in Japan in 1996, the Pokémon TCG quickly expanded worldwide, riding the wave of Pokémon’s popularity in video games and television. Early sets such as the Base Set, Jungle, and Fossil laid the foundation for a game that would become a major collectible and competitive pursuit.</li>
            <li>Evolution Over the Years:
                With each new generation of Pokémon games, the TCG has evolved—introducing fresh mechanics, new card types, and expanded lore. Recent sets have integrated modern gameplay elements like Tag Team cards, V/VSTAR cards, and dynamic support cards that keep the meta-game fresh and engaging.</li>
    </ul>

         <h2>Core Game Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Understanding the game is the first step to mastering it:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Card Types:</li>
    <li>Pokémon Cards: Represent the creatures used in battles. They come in two main forms: Basic Pokémon (which you can play directly) and Evolution Pokémon (which upgrade your Basic Pokémon).</li>
    <li>Energy Cards: These cards power your Pokémon’s attacks. There are different Energy types (such as Fire, Water, Grass) that correspond to Pokémon types.</li>
    <li>Trainer Cards: Provide effects that can help you draw extra cards, heal damage, or disrupt your opponent’s strategy.</li>
    <li>Gameplay Flow:
        Players begin with a deck (typically 60 cards) and set up a basic board with an active Pokémon and a bench of additional Pokémon. On each turn, players draw a card, attach Energy to their Pokémon, play Trainer cards, and then attack their opponent’s Pokémon. Winning usually requires knocking out a certain number of opponent’s Pokémon or meeting other victory conditions as defined by the game’s rules.</li>
        <li>Win Conditions:
            A match is typically won by either collecting all of your Prize cards (rewarded for knocking out opponent’s Pokémon) or by depleting your opponent’s deck so they can no longer draw a card.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Collecting & Card Rarity</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting aspects of the Pokémon TCG is collecting cards:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rarity Levels:

        <li>Common and Uncommon: Widely available and used as the backbone of many decks.</li>
        <li>Rare, Holo Rare, and Ultra Rare: Feature striking artwork and are harder to pull from packs.</li>
        <li>Secret Rare and Full Art Cards: Often include unique designs and can become highly sought-after collector’s items.</li>
        <li>Iconic Cards:
            Over the years, several cards have become legendary among collectors, such as the Base Set Charizard and other rare holographic cards. These cards are prized not only for their in-game utility but also for their nostalgic and investment value.</li>
            <li>Collecting Tips:
                Beginners are encouraged to start with pre-constructed starter decks, which offer a balanced introduction to the game. As you grow your collection, you can trade with friends, attend local events, or purchase booster packs to chase your favorite cards.</li>

    <li>World Championships: Held annually, this event draws elite competitors from around the globe who vie for the title of World Champion.</li>
    <li>Tournament Structure:
        Competitions are typically organized in a Swiss-system format, where players are paired based on their win-loss records over several rounds. A deep understanding of card interactions and deck construction is key to succeeding at these events.</li>
        <li>Community Engagement:
