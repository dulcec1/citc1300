            <h1>What is the Pokédex?</h1>
            <p>The **Pokédex** is an electronic device that records data on Pokémon encountered by a trainer. It is a **vital tool** for every Pokémon trainer, providing detailed information on the various species in the Pokémon world.</p>
            <p>In the Pokémon games, trainers use the **Pokédex** to collect data about Pokémon they’ve encountered during their journeys. As a trainer catches or sees more Pokémon, their Pokédex is updated with detailed entries about each Pokémon's habitat, abilities, and evolutions.</p>
            <p>The **Pokédex** is also a helpful tool for trainers when deciding which Pokémon to capture next. It lists the habitats and locations of different Pokémon, which is essential for **catching rare or legendary Pokémon**. It is often considered a **Pokémon encyclopedia**, providing trainers with everything they need to know about the Pokémon they encounter.</p>
            <p>For example, the **Kanto Pokédex** includes entries for the first 151 Pokémon, from **Bulbasaur** to **Mew**. In later regions, additional Pokémon were added, and the **Pokédex** grew in size and functionality. The Pokédex has evolved over time, and in modern games, it is often a feature within the **smartphone-like devices** of trainers.</p>
